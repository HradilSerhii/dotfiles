# Template for a full-text request on ResearchGate (PINGA lab version)

Dear XXX,

First of all, thank you for your interest in our work!

We at the PINGA lab try not to upload our work to ResearchGate because they are a for-profit organization. They have the practice of sometimes inserting advertisement into the uploaded PDFs.

We keep a copy of all our works on our website: http://www.pinga-lab.org

There you will also find links to related works and other resources like source code, presentations, data, etc.

The paper you have asked for is at:

*Optional*:
The article you have requested is open-access (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) and can also be freely downloaded from the publishers site:

Best regards,

Leonardo
