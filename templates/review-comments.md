# Review of "Paper title" by Paper Authors

Brief description of what the paper is about. This shows that I've read and
understood the paper.

General comments on the quality of the submission and my overall thoughts.
Outline major strengths and flaws.
Be sure to say something positive as well!
What should be done to address the problems?
Always give constructive feedback.

Thinks to check;
* Use of English
* Structure of the paper
* Novelty
* Correctness of the method
* Enough detail in methods to reproduce findings
* Conclusions backed by results?
* Cited proper references?

Some comments about the figures:
* Is the resolution good?
* Is there any improper use of jet/rainbow color maps? If so, cite Niccoli
  (2014) and Rougier et al. (2014).
* Are all necessary?
* Are any necessary figures missing?

Ask about source code and data.
Cite journal requirements, if there are any.

> The supplemental material should include "The original data and the processing

> Quoting from the SEG Ethical Guidelines (http://seg.org/Publications/Policies-and-Permissions/ethical-guidelines):
>
>     A submitted manuscript should contain detail and reference to public
>     sources of information sufficient to permit readers to reproduce the work
>     or verify its accuracy.

> With the highly computational nature of current geoscience, fundamental

> Therefore, I ask that the authors provide their original data (as much as
> legally possible) and the required source code to reproduce their results. This
